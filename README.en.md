  <h1>GreaterWMS</h1>
  <p>Fully Open Source Warehouse Management System</p>
</div>

The original vision for this software was to make it a framework that would facilitate warehouse management software development for everyone. However, we later discovered that we had written it as a complete software system, which was not what we intended.

Therefore, we have rewritten the underlying layer using Rust and Python as the carrier, creating a new CLI underlying framework called [Bomiot](https://gitee.com/Bomiot/Bomiot). It offers high performance and more convenient development, fully leveraging Python's inherent language advantages.

The old version of GreaterWMS files can be found here:
[GreaterWMS v2.1.49](https://gitee.com/Singosgu/GreaterWMS/tree/V2.1.49)

GreaterWMS will also use [Bomiot](https://gitee.com/Bomiot/Bomiot) for its 3.0 reconstruction.
